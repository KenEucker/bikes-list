AWS config w/Andrew
old instance details:
- t2.micro 
new instance details:
- t3.micro reserved instance reserved for 12 mo on 15 Jan 2020 @ cheaper price (63$/year) - 54.187.123.121 public IP
- additional 2Gb of storage
- keypair shift-server-2020 (fool and Andrew have private key)
instance agnostic details:
- 44.231.45.51 external elastic IP can be mapped to either host

new instance ubuntu setup details:
- stock ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64 bit
- apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; apt-get install certbot ; reboot
- josh/andrew/fool ssh keys installed and tested
(not actually sure if docker-compose upgrade is needed anymore? since we are sudo'ing and probably using the /usr/bin version...?  not sure, should test without and see...)
- upgrade docker-compose: curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
- `chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock` to fix docker-compose permission problems
	(old settings:
	ubuntu@ip-172-31-6-141:/var/run$ ls -ld docker.sock
	srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Jan 16 03:57 docker.sock
	)
		- will have to automate this since permissions get reset every reboot
- will have to restore database and eventimages from live host (`cd /opt/shift-docs ; cat backup.mysql | ./shift mysqlpipe` and handle images)

for temporary setup with different hostname:
- set hostname via 3 changes here: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-change-hostname-on-ubuntu-18-04/
- change hostname to `newshiftapi.shift2bikes.org` in DOMAIN="newshiftapi.shift2bikes.org"
- edit /opt/shift-docs/services/nginx/certbot.sh to include flags to certbot execution: 
	`--agree-tos --email  bikecal@shift2bikes.org`

---- in the end ----
- `shift up` should just work.

---- new work on 12 May 2021 ----
- added /usr/local/bin/certbot.sh from prod, and its associated crontab entry: `28 1 * * * sh /usr/local/bin/certbot.sh 2>&1 > /tmp/certbot-cron-out`.  This worked well!
