	  <strong>Family-Friendly</strong> events are those where parents are
	  specifically asked to bring their children.
	  In the weekly grid at the top of the calendar page, these events
	  are marked with <font color="green">green times</font>.
	  In the detailed event listings, they are marked with a tricycle
	  icon in the left margin.

	  <strong>Adult only (21+)</strong> events are those where children
	  are specifically not allowed, usually because the event takes place
	  in a bar.
	  In the weekly grid, these events are marked with
	  <font color="red">red times</font>.
	  In the detailed event listings, they are marked with a beer icon
	  in the left margin.

	  Most events are <strong>General audience</strong> events.
	  Children are allowed, but they may be bored or they may not have
	  enough stamina to enjoy the event.
	  If you have any questions, contact the event organizer.
	  (Contact information is listed at the bottom of each event in the
	  detailed listings.  If no other contact method is offered, use the
	  event's "<img src="../images/forum.gif" alt="Forum">" button.)
	  General audience events have plain <strong>black times</strong>
	  in the weekly grid, and have no icon in the detailed listings.
