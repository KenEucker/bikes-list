    <h1><center>Email Addresses</center></h1>
    Your email address is used the following ways:
    <ol>
      <li>
	The web site sends email to you every time your event is changed,
	whether by you or the calendar crew.
	The message includes the link for editing your event later,
	so it's kind of important.
	The subject lines of these messages all begin with
	"<code>[Shift&nbsp;Cal]</code>".
      <li>
	Each event has its own little forum.
	If you leave the "Send forum messages to this address" box checked,
	then whenever a message is added to the forum,
	a copy of that message will be emailed to you.
	The subject lines of these messages all begin with
	"<code>[Shift&nbsp;Cal</code><var>&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;title</var><code>]</code>".
      <li>
	The calendar crew may use this email address to contact you,
	human-to-human.
	This is expected to be rare though.
      <li>
	Unless you check the "Don't publish my email" box,
	your email address will be shown in the online calendar.
	Steps will be taken to prevent spammers from harvesting
	your address from the calendar:
	Some extra HTML tags will be thrown in, and portions of the
	address will actually be published as images instead of text.
	For example, the "@" will be replaced with an image that
	looks like an "@".
      <li>
	You can control whether your email address is shown in
	the printed calendar via "Printed contact info" field.
    </ol>
    <p>
      Note that if you don't publish your email address anywhere,
      people can still contact you via the forum.
      If you allow forum messages to be emailed to you,
      this is almost as convenient for you as direct email...
      though it's a little less convenient for the public because after
      they post a question to the forum, they must periodically check back
      to see if their question has been answered;
      i.e., they must go to the answer,
      instead of having the answer come to them
      as it would if the reply was emailed.
