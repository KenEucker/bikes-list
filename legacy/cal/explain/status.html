    For multi-day events, each date can have a separate status.
    Generally they start as "Added" when you're adding the event,
    and then show as "As Scheduled" when you edit the event later.
    The complete list of possible states is:
    <dl>
      <dt>Added
      <dd>The date will be added when you click [Add this event].

      <dt>Skipped
      <dd>The date will <em>not</em> be added when you click [Add this event]
	  even though the date does match the "dates" value that you typed in.

      <dt>As Scheduled
      <dd>The date was added when you first submitted the event, and it will
	  continue to be remain on the calendar when you click
	  [Update this event].

      <dt>Canceled
      <dd>The date used to be on the schedule.
          Now the calendar still remembers that date, but it is marked as
	  "Canceled".
	  You should probably use the "newsflash" field to briefly explain why.
          If you're moving it to a different day, you should mention that date.

      <dt>Deleted
      <dd>The date matches the "dates" value that you selected, but there is
          no record for that date.
	  Presumably there was one, and you deleted it.
          You can't use a newsflash for deleted days, since without a record
          there is no place to store the newsflash.

      <dt>Exception
      <dd>The event will take place, but something about it is different.
	  The calendar handles this by splitting that date off into its own
	  little event, which you can edit separately.
	  This is described in more detail below.

    <h2>How to use Exception dates</h2>
    This calendar allows a single event to occur on multiple dates.
    That's pretty easy most of the time,
    but in the real world plans change and the calendar needs to support that.
    Exceptions are a complex way to handle complex situations.
    <p>
    You don't need exceptions just to cancel a date within a multi-day event.
    You can cancel a date in the obvious way --
    change its status to "Canceled" and maybe explain why in the "newsflash".
    <p>
    But if you want to move the event to a different location, or change
    the starting time, or even the date, then exceptions come into play.
    <p>
    Edit the event (i.e., click on the link that was emailed to you
    when you first created the event).
    Scroll down to the "Date(s)" portion of the form, and look for the
    date that you want to change.
    Its status is probably "As Scheduled" at this point, but you should
    change it to "Exception".
    Then save the form <em>without changing anything else</em> because you
    don't want to change the location or time for the normal dates.
    You only want to change them for the exceptional date.
    <p>
    When you save the normal event, the next page your see on your browser
    will (among other things) list the edit link for the exception event.
    Click on that, to start editing the exception.
    <p>
    You'll notice that initially all of the normal event's information was
    copied to the exception event.
    The "Date(s)" value is automatically changed to the single exceptional
    date, but everything else looks exactly the same.
    You can now start changing anything you want.
    When it looks the way you want, click [Update this event].
    <p>
    When people view the calendar, they'll see the exception version of that
    event.
    The original event won't show on that date.

    <h2>Changing an Exception back to As Scheduled</h2>
    It's possible to make an exception date revert to a normal date.
    Basically you just delete the exception event, and then edit the normal
    event to make that date be "As Scheduled".
    In more detail, the steps needed are:
    <ol>
      <li>Edit the normal event by clicking the link that was emailed to you
	  when you first booked the event.
      <li>Scroll down to the "Date(s)" section, and click on the "Exception"
	  link for the exceptional date.
	  This will take you to the exceptional event.
      <li>In the exceptional event's edit form, scroll down to "Date(s)" and
	  observe that the value shown there is a single date -- the exceptional
	  date.
	  If it isn't, then you're probably still in the original event's edit
	  form.
	  Start over at step one, and be careful.
	  You don't want to delete the normal event!
      <li>Keep scrolling down.
	  At the bottom of the form (just above the preview), click the
	  "[Delete this event]" button.
	  When asked for confirmation, give it.
      <li>You'll be shown a page informing you that the exception event has been
	  deleted.
      <li>Go back to the normal event's edit form by clicking the emailed link
	  again.
      <li>Scroll down to "Date(s)" and notice that the exceptional date's status
	  has changed from "Exception" to "Deleted".
	  You can change it from "Deleted" to "As Scheduled", and save the form.
	  You're done.
    </ol>
    <p>
    Okay, that isn't easy.
    But exceptions aren't for easy situations.
    The exception mechanism is intended to be a super-flexible way to handle
    weird situations that don't occur too often.
    And reverting back to normal should be even rarer.
    
    <h2>An example of Exceptions</h2>
    The Midnight Mystery Ride meets on the second Friday of each month,
    but at a different location and with a different ride leader.
    <p>
    The overall coordinator, Team Midnight, can create a "Midnight Mystery Ride"
    event, and say the date is "Second Friday of each month".
    The contact information should be Team Midnight's email address.
    The meeting location should be "To Be Announced".
    This will create a bunch of placeholder events for the coming year.
    <p>
    As each month's ride leader is chosen, Team Midnight can go back into
    the generic "Midnight Mystery Ride" event and change that date's
    status to "Exception".
    That should be the only change made to the generic MMR event.
    <p>
    When the generic MMR event is saved, a new event will be created for the
    "Exception" date.
    Team Midnight can then go into the new "Exception" event and change its
    contact information (or at least the email address) to the ride leader's
    email address.
    When this is saved, the calendar will automatically send notification
    to the ride leader, telling them how they can edit the exception event.
    <p>
    The ride leader can then go into the exception event and change anything.
    They'll certainly want to change the start location.
    They may also want to change the contact information, or the description.
    These changes will only affect that date; the other dates will still be
    under the control of Team Midnight, and show the generic information.
    <p>
    Team Midnight can still edit the exception too, by going to the
    generic MMR event's edit form and clicking the "Exception" link in
    the list of dates.
