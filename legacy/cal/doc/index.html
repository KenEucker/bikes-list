    <h1>Documentation for the Shift Calendar</h1>
    This directory contains documentation for the Shift calendar.
    The documentation is intended to help you adapt the calendar software
    to your needs.
    <p>
    It is <strong>not</strong> intended for end-users.
    The calendar is meant to be intuitive enough that very little documentaion
    is needed to actually use it.  The only user documentation resides in the
    <a href="../explain/">explain</a> directory.
    <p>
    The documentation is split into multiple files:
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="features.html">features.html</a>
      <dd>Brief list of some of the calendar's distinctive features.

      <dt><a href="install.html">install.html</a>
      <dd>Step-by-step instructions on how to get started with the calendar.

      <dt><a href="appearance.html">appearance.html</a>
      <dd>This describes how to change the colors of the pages.  Sadly,
	  the calendar doesn't yet support "themes" so this is harder than
	  it should be.

      <dt><a href="code.html">code.html</a>
      <dd>This lists the source files and directorie,
	  and explains what they're for and how they relate to each other.

      <dt><a href="database.html">database.html</a>
      <dd>Details about the SQL tables used by the calendar.

      <dt><a href="update.html">update.html</a>
      <dd>Technical description of how dates are updated.

      <dt><a href="bugs.html">bugs.html</a>
      <dd>Yeah, it ain't perfect.

      <dt><a href="future.html">future.html</a>
      <dd>This lists some changes I'd like to make to the calendar some day.
