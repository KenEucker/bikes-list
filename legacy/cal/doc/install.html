    <h1>Installing the Shift Calendar</h1>
    This document describes how to install the Shift calendar on a site,
    and modify it to "fit" that site.
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Extract the files</strong><br>
	  The files will extract into a subdirectory named "cal".  I suggest
	  you do the extraction in your web site's top directory.  Once you've
	  done that, cd into that directory since that's where all the changes
	  will take place.

      <li><strong>Edit "include/account.php"</strong><br>
	  This file defines the MySQL account information, plus a few other
	  values which you'll certainly want to edit.
	  <p>
	  DBHOST is the name of the host where the MySQL server resides.
	  DBUSER is the MySQL account name.
	  DBPASSWORD is the password for that account.
	  DBDATABASE is a database name within MySQL.
	  <p>
	  Note that you can use an existing database, or create a new one
	  just for the calendar data.  If you decide to create a new one,
	  you'll need to do that manually; the calendar software won't
	  create it for you.
	  <p>
	  INCLUDES is the directory (relative to "cal") where the sites
	  shared files reside -- most importantly, many of the pages assume
	  that directory will contain "header.html" and "footer.html"
	  which are included at the top and bottom of each page.  (More
	  about header and footer, below.)
	  <p>
	  CALURL is a fully specified URL of the calendar directory.
	  <p>
	  MAINPAGE is the name of the page to show when CALURL is loaded
	  in a browser.  You'll probably want "view3week.php".
	  <p>
	  TZTWEAK is pretty much obsolete.  For a while, Shift's web site
	  was hosted on a system in another timezone, and we were using
	  PHP4 without specifying the timezone, so this was our workaround.
	  <p>
	  SHIFTEMAIL is the address for the calendar crew.  It is used as
	  the "From:" address of all email messages sent by the calendar
	  software.
	
      <li><strong>Edit "include/common.php"</strong><br>
	  This defines a few more constants that you may want to change,
	  up near the top of the file.
	  <p>
	  AREACODE is the default area code.  If an event organizer enters a
	  phone number with 7 digits, AREACODE will be automatically prepended
	  to it.
	  <p>
	  ADMINUSER and ADMINPASS are the hokey way of storing the calendar
	  administrator's username and password.
	  <p>
	  Next we come to a whole shitload of constants related to Pedalpalooza.
	  Most of these should be pretty obvious.  PPSMALL is the name of the
	  file containing the poster image that's displayed at the top of
	  the PPURL page.  PPLARGE is the name of a file containing the
	  full-size of the poster.
	  <p>
	  The "<code>date_default_timezone_set('America/Los_Angeles')</code>"
	  line sets the timezone.  See
	  <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php">php.net</a>
	  for a list of timezone values.  For Salt Lake City, I think you
	  want 'America/Boise'.

      <li><strong>Create the database tables</strong><br>
	  The easy way to create the tables is to use your browser to log in
	  to the administrator page (http://YOUR.SITE.HERE/cal/admin.php)
	  using the ADMINUSER and ADMINPASS defined in include/common.php.
	  Near the bottom of the menu, you'll find "Clobber the calendar data".
	  For safety's sake, you need to set the three pulldowns appropriately
	  and click [Now!].  The tables are created automatically, hooray!

      <li><strong>Test</strong><br>
	  You should now be able to add events!  Go to the 3-week view
	  (http://YOUR.SITE.HERE/cal/view3week.php).  It should be empty,
	  but otherwise intact.
	  <p>
	  Click the [Add an event] button, fill in the form, and submit it.
	  Cross your fingers, and verify that 1) the confirmation page says
	  the event was added successfully, 2) the calendar shows the event,
	  and 3) you received an email message giving a URL for editing your
	  event later.

      <li><strong>Customize the event form</strong><br>
	  Probably all you want to do is remove the area (Portland/Vancouver)
	  question.  Just hardcode it to be "P" by using
	  <code>&lt;input&nbsp;type="hidden"&nbsp;name="area"&nbsp;value="P"&gt;</code>.
	  You can remove the label and all visible parts of that row, but don't
	  remove the row itself because that would mess up the table formatting.

      <li><strong>Adjust the map</strong><br>
	  The Shift calendar used to use <u>http://tripplanner.bycycle.org/</u>,
	  a local online bike map.  In an event description, clicking on the
	  address of an event would take you to that map, with the address
	  plotted.  Sadly, bycycle.org's server died and there was no backup.
	  Its gone.  I have modified <var>include/view.php</var> to use
	  Google Maps instead, but this is only a rough hack.  Line 279 has
	  a hardcoded "bounds" parameter which encompasses Portland and the
	  surrounding area; you need to change "bounds" to encompass your
	  city.
	  <p>
	  The simplest way to get the bounds is to go to
	  <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, find your city,
	  zoom out so the entire city is visible, then right-click at one
	  corner of the bounding box and select "What's here?".  The latitude
	  and longitude will be shown in the map's search box at the top of
	  the page.  Then go to the opposite corner of the bounding box and
	  do the same to find its coordinates.  The "bounds" parameter is
	  the two latitude and longitude pairs, with a "|" between them.

      <li><strong>Change colors</strong><br>
	  Shifttobikes.org is very orange.  You'll probably want to change
	  the calendar's colors on your site.  Unfortunately I never got
	  around to implementing themes in the calendar, so this won't be
	  easy.  See <a href="appearance.html">appearance.html</a> for some
	  tips on how to go about it.
