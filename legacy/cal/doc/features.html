    <h2>Features</h2>
    The calendar has an interesting feature set.
    Some of these were carefully designed in from the beginning, and
    some just sort of happened.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Very little administration is required.</strong><br>
	  Users can add their own events, and edit them later.
	  Administrators only need to get involved when an inappropriate event
	  is added, or when a user looses the edit link for their event.

      <li><strong>Users don't need to set up an account.</strong><br>
	  When a user adds an event, the calendar sends them an email message
	  containing a link they can use to edit the event later.
	  The link is what gives them access to the event; they don't need to
	  remember yet another username and password.

      <li><strong>Repeating events are very well supported.</strong><br>
	  The date parser is versatile and intuitive.
	  If you want to add an event that occurs on the last Thursday
	  of each month, you would simply give "last Thursay" as the date.

      <li><strong>Variations in repeating events are supported</strong><br>
	  Once a repeating event has been set up, you can mark some instances
	  of that event as being "exceptions".  That lets you change
	  <em>anything</em> about the event for that date -- the meeting
	  location, the time, the details in the description, whatever.

      <li><strong>Its a year-round calendar, but it also supports a big annual festival.</strong><br>
	  The administrator can set up dates for a big multi-day festival.
	  Any events that fall during those days will (potentially) be included
	  in the event calendar.  You can set up a special page showing just
	  the festival dates, with an image of the poster and other special
	  features.

      <li><strong>The festival calendar can be read on a mobile device</strong>
	  There's a separate "mobilepp" view which sends as little data as
	  possible, and doesn't depend on any particular type of pointing
	  device.

      <li><strong>It can export festival events to Google Calendar</strong>
	  It can generate in iCal document describing the documents.
	  You can configure Google Calendar to read this directly,
	  after which it will automatically maintain its own up-to-date copy
	  of the event list.  Some users like to do this so they can see
	  how the festival events interact with their other commitments.

      <li><strong>It can export festival events, for generating a printed version.</strong><br>
	  Festival events can be exported in comma-separate-values format,
	  tab-separated-values format, or a simple HTML format.

      <li><strong>Prep work for the printed festival calendar can begin before the submission deadline.</strong><br>
	  The calendar administrator can flag some events for omission from
	  the printed festival calendar.  This work can begin before the
	  submission deadline; as users add more events or change existing
	  ones, the calendar keeps track of their review status.
	  This way, the calendar administrator doesn't need to pull an
	  all-nighter to get the data to the layout artist on time.

      <li><strong>Users can make their own custom pocket reference for the festival.</strong><br>
	  Each user can select the events they're interested in, and print
	  them on a single page which folds to make a pocket-sized 8-page
	  reference.  Users can also share their lists, or merge others'
	  lists with theirs.

      <li><strong>Its code is portable.</strong><br>
	  It can run on any web server that has PHP and MySQL... which pretty
	  much means anywhere.  I developed it under Linux, but PHP and MySQL
	  do run under Windows.
    </ul>
