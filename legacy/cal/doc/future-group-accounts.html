    <h1>Group Accounts</h1>
    Anybody can add an event to the calendar;
    you don't need an account to do that.
    <p>
    However, if you expect to add multiple events then there are some real
    advantages to establishing an account:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Easier to add new events.</strong>
	Your contact information and default image are pre-filled on the
	event entry form.
      <li><strong>Easier to add a repeat event.</strong>
	If a new event is similar to a previous event you did, you can
	copy the old event to a new date and then edit it.
      <li><strong>Easier to edit events.</strong>
	When you log in, you can see all of your events at once, and
	edit any of them just by clicking on it.
      <li><strong>Easier to promote your events within your group.</strong>
	You can embed a calendar into your own web page, showing just your
	events, in a color theme that you choose.
    </ul>
