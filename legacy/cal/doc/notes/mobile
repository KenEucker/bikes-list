Keep in mind the "best practices" listed at http://www.w3.org/TR/mwabp

The basic design is a list of dates.  Clicking on a date shows that date's
events; if the events haven't been loaded yet, then it shows a spinner
while it reads event data in the background; when the data is fully received,
the spinner is replaced by the data.  Clicking on a date when the events
are already being shown hides the events (without deleting them from the
page).

Initially, each event lists only its start time and title.  Clicking on
the time/title displays the details.  (They're fetched with rest of the
day's schedule, but not initially shown.)  Clicking the event title again
hides the event details.

IDEA FOR VERSION 1.1: Initially, only the short "print" description is
shown; clicking the details will fetch the full details of the event as
shown in the normal online calendar, including the event's image if it
has one.  Once this is done, there's no way to revert to the simpler
"print" description again, except by reloading the whole page.

Initially, today's events are loaded & shown (but their details are not),
tomorrow's and the following weekend are loaded but not shown.  Other
days' events will be loaded as requested.  The display is initially
scrolled down to put today's schedule at the top.  Today's date initially
has input focus.

Graphics

Each date will be shown in a bar.  Today's date will have a lighter color.
If a date's events are listed, the left edge of the bar extends downward,
visually grouping the day's events.

Similarly, each time/title is shown in a bar (inset slightly to allow
room for the extended part of the date bar).  If the details are shown,
the left edge of the bar extends downward to group the details to the
time/title.

This is implemented via a table, where the background color of each cell
is manipulated to generate the bars.  The table is 4 cells wide: The
extended part of a date bar, the gap after it, the extended part of the
title bar, and the details.  The gap after the title bar extension is
implemented by setting the left margin of the description cell.  The
horizontal gaps between bars are also implemented via cells.

<html><head>
  <title>Pedalpalooza 2011</title>
  <style type="text/css">
    td.date { background: orange; }
    td.today { background: jj
  </style>
</head><body>
<table border=0>
  <tr><td class=date colspan=4>Thu Jun 9: Kickoff Ride</tr>
  <tr><td class=gap colspan=4></td></tr>
  <tr><td class=date colspan=4>Fri Jun 10: MMR</td></tr>
  <tr><td class=date></td><td class=gap><td class=timetitle colspan=2>11pm MMR</td></tr>
  <tr><td class=date></td><td class=gap><td class=timetitle></td><td class=details>Meet at 11pm, at midnight we ride!<br>Plan B, SE 8th and Main<br>Each month a different ride leader takes to a different destination. BYOB</br>Team Midnight</td></tr>
  <tr><td class=date colspan=4>Sat Jun 11: Splashdance</td></tr>
</table>

Implemented via nested DIV blocks.  Each date is a DIV with the date
link always shown.  The top border is a solid orange line.  The link
background is a horizontal orange smear.

Each date's events are in a nested DIV block which may be hidden or
shown; clicking the date link toggles its visibility.  If it becomes
visible when the date's events haven't been loaded then it shows a
spinner while a background HTTP request fetches the events.  The div
has a vertical smear along the left edge as its background.  Its margin
is large enough to prevent events from covering it.  Clicking on this
DIV is like clicking on the date link; this is intended to allow people
to click on the vertical smear to hide the events.

Each event is in its own DIV block.  The top of these DIVs contain a
link showing the time and title of the event.  The top and left borders
are solid medium orange lines.  The time/title background is medium orange.

The details are in yet another nested DIV block.  This one has no special
characteristics.  Clicking the time/title link toggles its visibility.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per w3.org's suggestions, the display should support focus based
input where you move from link to link, pointer based where precise
cursor positioning is not always practical, and touch based where
rollover highlighting won't work.

The dates and times/titles should be links.  When the link has focus,
it should be highlighted by making it slightly larger and adding a
halo around the text.  Rollovers are not used.
