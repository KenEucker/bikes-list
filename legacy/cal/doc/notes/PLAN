In the list of actual dates, there are three options:

* For new dates, simply list the date without allowing it to be edited in
  any way.

* For modified dates, show a link to the form for editing that particular
  day.  (I.e., it's a link to the /calform.php?edit=... for the modified
  day, which is now mostly independent of the normal event.)  Before the
  link is followed, use a confirm() call to let the user know that any
  other changes they've made will be discarded.

* For normal, existing dates, use a <select> input to allow the status to
  be changed.  Each one has a unique name, corresponding to the date.
  The statuses are:

	As scheduled
	Canceled
	Moved to XXXX  (several options for all the most likely dates)
	Modified

  The list of "Moved to" dates includes 1 week earlier, 2 days earlier,
  1 day earlier, 1 day later, 2 days later, 1 week later.  Past days are
  omitted from the list.  (Should there be a way to specify other days?
  If so, do we really need a list of likely days?)  DECISION: In the first
  version, only the likely days will be offered.

In addition, each date as a "newsflash" text input.  These, too, have
unique names.

Complication: If the "dates" parameter is changed, then the list of dates
that need to be checked for will vary, depending on what we already have
on file as well as the parameter.  This isn't too weird though -- the same
function that vfydates.php uses can also be used in submit.php.

Complication: If only a single day is involved, then the newsflash is a
separate line under the description.  The name of this input should be
"newsflash", and its value should only be used if we know there's only
a single date.  Note that moving an event causes both its old date and
new date to be involved.
