    <h1>Bugs</h1>
    This couldn't possibly be an exhaustive list.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The address verifier is not working.  This is because it depended on
          <u>http://tripplanner.bycycle.org/</u>, which died.  I need to modify
	  it to use Google Maps' API.

      <li>In calsubmit.php, line 443, sometimes $status isn't getting set
	  correctly.  This is a rare bug, and collecting information about
	  it is tricky.  Maybe modify calsubmit.php to send email to me when
	  it detects this.  (This bug is causing some events to be added
	  without dates.)
    </ul>
