    <h1>Appearance</h1>
    This document gives some information about how to change the appearance
    of the calendar pages.
    <p>
    I never got around to creating themes for the calendar, or even external
    CSS stylesheets.

    <h2>Colors</h2>
    Most pages inherit their colors from the header and footer;
    i.e., you can put <code>&lt;div style="background: white"&gt;</code>
    at the end of the <var>../includes/header.html</var> file, and
    <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> at the beginning of the
    <var>../includes/footer.html</var> file to get a
    white background... on most pages.
    <p>
    However on the pages that people use the most, such as
    <var>view3week.php</var>, the entire content is wrapped in a
    <code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code> block,
    and uses the style <code>div.content&nbsp;{background:$#ffc969;}</code>
    to make the background be light orange.  The historical justification
    for this is, Shift's normal orange background is rather dark, and
    some people had a hard time reading it.  So I lightened it.
    So if merely changing the page's style via
    <var>../includes/header.html</var> doesn't fix a page, then you should
    edit that page and look for "div.content".
    <p>
    There are other aspects of color, of course, but they don't follow
    much of a pattern.  I used colors to distinguish labels from data,
    background images as a form of highlighting, etc.  In views that show
    a weekly grid at the top of the page, the current day is highlighted
    with a background color via some JavaScript near the bottom of the
    page.
    <p>
    I can tell you that I've been tweaking the colors of each year's
    <var>viewppXXXX.php</var> page so it <strong>can</strong> be done.

<h2>Images</h2>
    Most of the images in the "images" directory are not likely to require
    any changes for themes.  However, the images described below may be
    relevant.
    <dl>
      <dt>images/oocorner.gif
      <br>images/bluecorner.gif
      <br>images/greencorner.gif
      <br>images/orangecorner.gif
      <br>images/purplecorner.gif
      <dd>These are the big smear that's used as the background
	  for dates in the detail section, below the calendar grid.
	  oocorner is the orange version with a clear background.
	  orangecorner is orange with a white background.  Other
	  images have a clear background, but look best when layered
	  on a white-backgrounded page.
	  <p>
	  Note: a <code>&lt;div class="hr"&gt;</code> tag with a
	  similarly-colored background is used to complete the line
	  across the page.

      <dt>images/bones.gif
      <br>images/bones-green.gif
      <dd>These are the sqiggly background that viewpp2012 uses in
	  the weekly grid for the weekend background.  "bones.gif"
	  is orange, and "bones-green.gif" is greenish.

      <dt>images/mcbf_bg.gif
      <br>images/mcbf_bg-green.gif
      <br>images/mcbf_bg-yellow.gif
      <dd>This is sort of a Cowboy image that viewpp2012 uses in
	  the weekly grid for the background of the day that the
	  Multnomah County Bike Fair occurs.  "mcbf-bg.gif" is the
	  orange version.

      <dt>images/chain.gif
      <dd>This is a short twisted piece of orange bike chain, shown
	  after an event's title so people have something they can
	  right-click and "copy link address" from.

	      
      <dt>images/ootall.gif
      <dd>This is a vertical smear, used in the section labels of
	  the event form, "calform.php".  Again, there is only an
	  orange version available.  It has a pale orange background,
	  not a clear background, dammit.

      <dt>images/owall.gif
      <dd>This is a stucco-texture image, in pale orange, that's used
	  in the forum, "calforum.php", for the background of messages
	  posted by the event organizer or calendar administrator.
	  A few other places too.

      <dt>images/trimetrose.gif
      <dd>This is the logo of Tri-Met, our city bus service.  I imagine
	  you'll want to replace it with your own.
