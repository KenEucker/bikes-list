    <h1>Database</h1>
    This document describes the MySQL database tables.
    <p>
    The two most important tables are
    <a href="#calevent">calevent</a> which stores events, and
    <a href="#caldaily">caldaily</a> which stores which dates
    the events occur on.  There's also
    <a href="#calforum">calforum</a> for storing forum messages, and
    <a href="#caladdress">caladdress</a> for storing the names and addresses
    of known venues.
    <p>
    The tables are defined in the <var>admclobber.php</var> script.
    The definitions below are derived from that script.

    <h2><a name="calevent">calevent</a></h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>CREATE TABLE calevent (

      <dt>modified TIMESTAMP,
      <dd>This indicates when the record was added or modified.  It is
	  used mostly so the ppadmin.php page can highlight recently
	  changed events.

      <dt>id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      <dd>This is a unique id.  It will be used later to associate the
	  forum records and the image file with each event.  It will also
	  be used via the "edit" parameter in an obscured format to allow
	  the event to be edited by the event's organizer later.

      <dt>name VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Name of the organizer.

      <dt>email VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Email of the organizer.  This must be a valid address, because
	  the ppsubmit.php file will send a confirmation email to that
	  address whenever the event is changed.  Also, forum message may
	  be sent there.

      <dt>hideemail INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the organizer's email address should be hidden in the
	  online calendar, or 0 to show it.  If the email is shown, it will
	  be mangled to prevent spammers from harvesting it.

      <dt>emailforum INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if messages added to the event's forum should be sent
	  to the above email address, or 0 if they shouldn't.

      <dt>printemail INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the organizer's email address should be printed in
	  the online calendar, or 0 if it should be omitted.  Note that
	  this is backwards from the hideemail flag.

      <dt>phone VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>The organizer's phone number.

      <dt>hidephone INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the organizer's phone number should be hidden in
	  the online calendar, or 0 to show it.

      <dt>printphone INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the organizer's phone number should be shown in the
	  printed calendar, or 0 to hide it.  Note this is backward from
	  the hidephone field.

      <dt>weburl VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>The URL of the origanizer's web site.

      <dt>webname VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>The name of the organizer's web site.  Often this is a stripped-
	  down version of the URL.

      <dt>printweburl INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the URL should be shown in the printed calendar,
	  or 0 to omit it.  (The weburl would be printed, not the webname.)

      <dt>contact VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Any other contact information for the event organizer.  If there's
	  more than one organizer, this is a good place to put an extra
	  email address.

      <dt>hidecontact INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the contact info should be omitted from the online
	  calendar, or 0 to show it.

      <dt>printcontact INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 to include the contact info in the print calendar, or
	  0 to omit it.

      <dt>title VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Full name of the event.  Note that the Pedalpalooza calendar
	  displays this in uppercase, though it is stored in mixed-case.

      <dt>tinytitle VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Short version of the title, used mostly in the weekly calendar
	  grid at the top of the calendar page.

      <dt>audience CHAR(1),
      <dd>Who the ride is for.  This is a single letter:
	  <table>
	    <tr><th>F</th><td><strong>Family-friendly.</strong>
		Parents are specifically asked to bring children.</td></tr>
	    <tr><th>A</th><td><strong>Adult-only (21+).</strong>
		You must be of legal drinking age, probably because the
		event takes place in a bar.</td></tr>
	    <tr><th>G</th><td><strong>General.</strong>
		Most events are for a general audience.  Anybody is welcome,
		but the children may become bored or they may lack endurance
		to fully enjoy it.</td><tr>
	  </table>

      <dt>descr TEXT,
      <dd>Description of the event.  This is a text field, in which the
	  following text is handled specially:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Trailing whitespace is removed
	    <li>Any word or group of words surrounded by asterisks will be
	        displayed in boldface, without the asterisks.
	    <li>URLs or domain names will be rendered as hypertext links.
	    <li>Special characters are converted to HTML entities.
	  </ul>

      <dt>printdescr TEXT,
      <dd>Shorter description of the event, for the printed calendar.
	  No special formatting or boldface is allowed here, because that
	  would make calendar layout much harder.

      <dt>newsflash TEXT,
      <dd>Usually empty, but if an event is changed at the last minute
	  (e.g., cancelled because of weather) then a description of the
	  change should go here.  If this field contains any text at all,
	  then the event's tinytitle is displayed in magenta in the weekly
	  calendar grid, and the text itself is displayed in magenta after
	  the full description lower in the online calendar page.

      <dt>image VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>This is the name of the image file on the organizer's computer.
	  If the event has no image, then this will be empty.  Note that
	  on the server, the image is stored in "eventimages/$record[id].jpg".
	  (E.g., "eventimages/381.jpg" is the image for the event that has
	  id=381.)  The image name is stored here only so we can tell the user
	  what that name is the next time they edit the event.

      <dt>imageheight INT,
      <dd>Height of the event's image, if any.

      <dt>imagewidth INT,
      <dd>Width of the event's image, if any.

      <dt>dates VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Dates of the event, as a string such as "Every Sunday".
	  The calsubmit.php page also generates a caldaily record for each
	  individual date implied by the dates string.

      <dt>datestype CHAR,
      <dd>This characterizes the dates string.  "O" means it is a one-time
	  event, "C" means it happens on two or more consecutive days, and
	  "S" means is it scattered over multiple non-consecutive days.
	  For example, "Every Sunday" would have datestype="C".

      <dt>eventtime TIME,
      <dd>Start time of the event.

      <dt>eventduration INT,
      <dd>Duration of the event, in seconds.  This is used to compute the
	  ending time of the event.  This way, if the eventtime is changed,
	  then the ending time will automatically change too.  As a special
	  case, if eventduration=0 then the duration and ending time are
	  considered to be unspecified.

      <dt>timedetails VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>This is a text field, used for storing a comment about the time.
	  It is often empty, but if the meet-up time is different than the
	  ride time ("Meet at 11pm, at midnight we ride!") or if there are
	  multiple meeting locations then you can put that here.
	  <p>
	  If timedetails is non-empty, then it is shown in the calendar
	  in parentheses immediately after the start/end times.

      <dt>address VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Street address or cross-streets where the event takes place.
	  If it's a ride, this is the meet-up location.  Ideally this
	  address should be parseable by tripplanner.bycycle.org.

      <dt>addressverified CHAR(1),
      <dd>This is "Y" if the address is believed to be parseable by
	  online maps, or some other value if there's a problem.  The
	  calendar pages will render the address as a hypertext link to
	  Google Maps if this is "Y" so participants can simply
	  click on the address to see it on a map.

      <dt>locdetails VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>This is a name or description of the address.  For example, if
	  address="20th and Belmont", then locdetails might be "Col. Summers
	  Park".

      <dt>area CHAR(1),
      <dd>This is "P" for Portland or "V" for Vancouver.  Vancouver events
	  have blue titles in the weekly calendar grid, and a "WA" icon in
	  the margin of the full description lower in the online calendar
	  page.

      <dt>external VARCHAR(250),
      <br>source VARCHAR(250),
      <dd>THESE ARE UNUSED.  The plan is to eventually use them to allow
	  Shift's calendar to import events from another calendar.  source
	  is intended to be the URL that the calendar data is read from,
	  and the combination of source and external are intended to provide
	  a globally-unique identifier for each imported event.

      <dt>nestid INT REFERENCES calevent(id),
      <br>nestflag VARCHAR(1),
      <dd>THESE ARE UNUSED.  The idea is to provide a simple way to group
	  events together.  For example, we could set up a "Pedalpalooza 2013"
	  event to occur on sequential days in June, and then nest other
	  events inside "Pedalpalooza 2013" by setting the included events'	
	  nestid equal to "Pedalpalooza 2013" event's id.  The nestflag is
	  intended to say why they're nested.  nestflag="F" means its a
	  festival, "G" means its a group (sort of a half-thought-out way
	  to let other biking groups "own" their own slice of the calendar),
	  and anything else means its a normal event.

      <dt>review CHAR(1),
      <dd>This is used by the admreview.php page to keep track of the review
	  status of each event.  "I" means it needs to be inspected, "A" means
	  the administrator has approved it for inclusion the the printed
	  Pedalpalooza calendar, "E" means the administrator has decided to
	  exclude it from the printed calendar, "S" means a message has been
	  sent to the event organizer asking them to change it, "R" means
	  the event organizer did change it in response to that message.

      <dt>highlight INT
      <dd>This is 1 if the event should be highlighted in the Pedalpalooza
	  calendar (both printed and online).  Shift only highlights events
	  that are officially organized by Shift -- any other plan is likely
	  to alienate organizers of unhighlighted events.

    <h2><a name="caldaily">caldaily</a></h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>CREATE TABLE caldaily (

      <dt>modified TIMESTAMP,
      <dd>Timestamp, indicates when this caldaily record was added or modified.

      <dt>id INT REFERENCES calevent,
      <dd>Indicates which event this caldaily record is for.

      <dt>newsflash TEXT,
      <dd>Stores the "newsflash" text for a given date of an event.  This is
	  used for late updates, and is displayed on calendar pages in magenta.
	  A typical example of a newsflash text would be "Moved to December 2".

      <dt>eventdate DATE,
      <dd>A date of the event.  Usually these are generated automatically from
	  the calevent.dates string.

      <dt>eventstatus VARCHAR(1),
      <dd>This indicates the status of the date.  Usually it is "A" for
	  "As scheduled".  It can also be "S" for "Skipped", "C" for "Canceled",
	  or "E" for exeception.

      <dt>exceptionid INT
      <dd>If eventstatus="E" then exceptionid is the calevent.id number of the
	  exception event.

	  When you schedule a multi-day event, you can then go in and make
	  some dates of that event be exceptions.  For example, if you have
	  an event that occurs on the second Friday of each month, but meets
	  in a different place each month, then you could create a generic
	  version of that event that occurs "Second Friday" and has "TBA" as
	  the address; then, as each month's location is chosen, you could
	  make that month be an exception and edit its address to be
	  the real address.)

      <dt>msgid INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
      <dd>Unique ID identifying this message.

      <dt>id INT REFERENCES calevent,

      <dt>organizer INT(1),
      <dd>This is 1 if the message was posted by either the event organizer
	  or the calendar administrator, or 0 otherwise.  In the calforum.php
	  page, messages from the organizer or administrator are highlighted.

      <dt>name VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Name (or nickname) of the poster.

      <dt>subject VARCHAR(255),
      <dd>Subject of the message.
