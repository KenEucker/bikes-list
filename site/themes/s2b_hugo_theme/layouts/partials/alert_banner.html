    <p><strong>To stem the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon,  Oregon is taking a phased approach to reopen the state on a county by county basis. Multnomah County is currently in a <a href="https://multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/notifications/november-13-oregon-placed-2-week-freeze-multnomah-county">four-week "freeze" from November 18 to December 16</a>. County Health officials have set a maximum of 6 people for all social gatherings, from no more than 2 households â€“ indoor and outdoor. Participants should maintain social distance of six feet. Masks are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing of at least six feet is not possible.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We strongly encourage everyone on a ride to wear a mask. Group bike rides are dynamic events and it can be difficult to maintain six feet of distance at all times. At minimum, we recommend you keep a mask/face covering around your neck that you can easily pull up when near other people.</strong></p>
