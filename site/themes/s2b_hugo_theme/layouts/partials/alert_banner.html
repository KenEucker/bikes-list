    <p><strong>To stem the spread of COVID-19 in the Portland area, Oregon and Washington state are taking a phased approach to reopen. All Portland-area counties are currently at the highest risk levels and have restrictions on gatherings. Health officials have set a maximum of 6 people for all social gatherings, from no more than 2 households â€“ indoor and outdoor. Participants should maintain social distance of six feet. Masks are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing of at least six feet is not possible.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We strongly encourage everyone on a ride to wear a mask. Group bike rides are dynamic events and it can be difficult to maintain six feet of distance at all times. At minimum, we recommend you keep a mask/face covering around your neck that you can easily pull up when near other people.</strong></p>
