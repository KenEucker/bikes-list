<strong class="pp-headline">Pedalpalooza is going to be different this year!</strong>

Pedalpalooza 2020 is about individuals finding ways to celebrate the joy of cycling. We will not be encouraging people to gather, as we have in previous years.

Join the movement! Find out ways you can promote #bikefun separately, but together.

<p class="pp-headline">Check out <a href="http://pedalpalooza.org">Pedalpalooza.org</a> for themed solo ride ideas!</p>

More details coming here soon!
