## Shift brings people in the Portland metro area together with bike fun

Shift encourages folks to create and participate in bike fun.  While our focus is local to the Portland area, our mission is wider:  fun on bikes changes lives and the world.

Come ride your bike with us! Most rides are non-competitive and free-wheeling, tending toward social speeds and smiles. Once you feel comfortable in the saddle, you are encouraged to lead a ride of your own.

Shift is a framework and an enabler - a place to connect with folks, rather than an event organizer.  Our two most notable features fall in this category:

1. [Our online calendar](/calendar/)
2. [Pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza)

**You can see all of the [pages on this website here](/pages).**

## Participating

Shift is entirely volunteer-run, and participant funded.  Join us!

First and easiest is to [come on a bike ride](/calendar/).  That's almost always free and you're welcome on any ride listed on the calendar.

If you want to volunteer, great!  There are *lots of things* you could do to help described on our [participation page](/pages/participation).

If you'd like to donate, that's great too! We don't spend or gather a lot of money, but it does cost money to host our website and to pay the artists who create art for us (particularly [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza) - check out the [gallery of past posters](/pages/pedalpalooza-posters-past)!)
