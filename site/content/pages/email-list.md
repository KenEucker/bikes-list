For the first 10 years of its life, shift was centered around bikes, but also... an email list with hundreds of participants: all from or interested in Portland.
Shenanigans and flame wars and over a hundred messaages a month.

Today it's much quieter, but conversations spark up on occasion, and it's a great place to promote your ride or scheme about [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza]) or warn people about hazards to bike fun.

[You can sign up on this webpage](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/shift).

Once subscribed, you have the option of receiving the list via email or viewing on the web.
