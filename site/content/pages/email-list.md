For the first 10 years of its life, shift was centered around bikes, but also... a very active email community with hundreds of participants: all from or interested in biking in Portland. There were shenanigans and flame wars and over a hundred messages a month.

Today it's much quieter, but conversations spark up on occasion, and it's a great place to promote your ride or scheme about [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza]) or warn people about hazards to bike fun.
