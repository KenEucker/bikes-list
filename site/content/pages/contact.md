Shift attempts to be a transparent organization.  Most of the organizational work for the organization is done at the monthly board meetings which you are welcome to attend.  We post our [meeting minutes](/pages/meeting-minutes) on this website if you don't want to sit with us for a couple hours.

If you want to get in touch with the board as a whole, [you can email the board of directors here](mailto:shift-bod@googlegroups.com).  If you want to get in touch with the Shift community, most general discussion about the community and events takes place on the [mailing list](/pages/email-list/) which you're encouraged but not required to join.

Shift also maintains a small presence on social media:

- [Shift facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shift2bikes/) isn't super active.
- [Pedalpalooza facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pedalpalooza/) has a lot more activity - mostly in June during [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza).
- [Pedalpalooza twitter](https://twitter.com/pedalpalooza) is also pretty active in June

If you want to get in touch with folks about these specific projects, you'll probably get the fastest response via their own channels:

- **[PDX World Naked Bike Ride](https://pdxwnbr.org/contact/)** (website contact form)
- **[Breakfast on the Bridges](/pages/bonb)** has a [mailing list](mailto:bonb@lists.riseup.net).
- **(Portland area) [Move by Bike](/pages/mbb)** has a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/movebybike).
- **[web calendar developers](mailto:bikecal@shift2bikes.org)** (mailing list)
