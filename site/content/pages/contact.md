Shift also maintains a small presence on social media:

* [Shift facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shift2bikes/) isn't super active.
* [Pedalpalooza facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pedalpalooza/) has a lot more activity - mostly in June during [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza).
* [Pedalpalooza twitter](https://twitter.com/pedalpalooza) is also pretty active in June

If you want to get in touch with folks about these specific projects, you'll probably get the fastest response using one of the following channels:
