## About

The Oregon Health Authority is responding to an outbreak of respiratory illness, called [COVID-19](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19), caused by a novel (new) coronavirus. Health officials urge [social distancing](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2268.pdf), good hand hygiene, covering coughs, and staying home if you are sick. For additional information and resources, see the [Multnomah County COVID-19 FAQ](https://multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-faq).

To stem the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon, [Executive Order 20-12](https://www.oregon.gov/newsroom/Pages/NewsDetail.aspx?newsid=36240) prohibits all non-essential social and recreational gatherings of individuals, regardless of size. **Until further notice, all Shift calendar events on or after March 23, 2020 are cancelled**. But read on — bike fun will still find a way!

## Riding safely

Shift encourages you to ride your bike as a source of fun and exercise while also maintaining a safe distance from others during the current health crisis. According to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, this means you should only ride if you can stay at least six feet away from other people. 

Please be mindful and patient with other riders out on the roads and paths, and give yourself and others plenty of space. Due to the unpredictability of road conditions, and scenarios, **we cannot recommend gathering for rides at this time**.

The following is a list of articles about biking during the current health crisis from a variety of perspectives. Shift does not endorse any of these articles, but encourages you to do your own research to make choices that respect local, state, and federal regulations during this crisis.

## Calendar changes

During this time of "stay home" guidelines, we've temporarily turned on a blanket cancellation for all [events](/calendar/). If you're a ride host, this means that even if you haven't cancelled yours individually, it will still show as cancelled.

Since our calendar is so focused on group gatherings, our consensus was to play it safe for now and cancel everything. As conditions change and guidelines are updated, we'll be working to figure out the best way for the calendar to facilitate responsible, inclusive bike fun. Stay tuned! 

In the meantime, check out this year's special [Pedalpalooza calendar](/pedalpalooza-calendar/)! It's full of great ideas for solo bike fun. Also, the [Shift list](/pages/email-list/) is always open for bikey discussion. So even as we ride our own paths these days, stay in touch with your fellow bike funnists and keep the conversation going 'til we meet again. 

Stay safe, stay healthy!
