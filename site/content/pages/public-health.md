## About

The Oregon Health Authority is responding to an outbreak of respiratory illness, called [COVID-19](https://govstatus.egov.com/OR-OHA-COVID-19), caused by a novel (new) coronavirus. Health officials urge [social distancing](https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2268.pdf), good hand hygiene, covering coughs, and staying home if you are sick. For additional information and resources, see the [Multnomah County COVID-19 FAQ](https://multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-faq).

To stem the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon, all non-essential social and recreational gatherings of individuals are currently prohibited by state order, regardless of size. **Until further notice, all social group rides are cancelled.** But read on — bikes will find a way!

## Riding safely

Shift encourages you to ride your bike as a source of fun and exercise while also maintaining a safe distance from others during the current health crisis. According to the Portland Bureau of Transportation, this means you should only ride if you can stay at least six feet away from other people. 

Please be mindful and patient with other riders out on the roads and paths, and give yourself and others plenty of space. Due to the unpredictability of road conditions, and scenarios, group rides are not recommended at this time.

The following is a list of articles about biking during the current health crisis from a variety of perspectives. Shift does not endorse any of these articles, but encourages you to do your own research to make choices that respect local, state, and federal regulations during this crisis.

## Calendar changes

<p style="text-align: center; padding: 1em; color: #663300; border: 1px solid #FFDD66; background: #FCFAF2; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;"><strong>For special events that support the demand for justice, please see our <a href="/pages/bike-for-justice/">Bike for Justice</a> page.</strong></p>

During this time of "stay home" guidelines, we've temporarily cancelled or hidden all current social group rides on the [calendar](/calendar/). If you're a ride host, this means that even if you haven't cancelled yours individually, it will still show as cancelled or may no longer be visible on the calendar. 

At this time, please do **not** post general social group rides. Instead, consider posting events that don't involve gathering in a group, such as: 

* **Online events:** Bike-y online events like meetings, socials, livestreams, and more
* **Distributed events:** Rides that happen at a specific time, but everyone participates from their own, separate location. The [May 2020 Midnight Mystery Ride](https://midnightmysteryride.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/may-ride-switching-things-up/) is a great example! 
* **Ride anytime routes:** A specific route that people can ride at any time they'd like. You can post it on a specific day, but set a wide time range to encourage people not to gather at one time. For example, the listing could start at 9am and end at 10pm. Check out [Pedalpalooza.org/ride](https://www.pedalpalooza.org/ride) for lots of great examples. 

Moderators may modify or remove event listings if they don't fit into one of the categories above. If you have any questions, [contact us](/pages/contact/). 

Also, check out this year's special [Pedalpalooza calendar](/pedalpalooza-calendar/)! It's full of great ideas for solo bike fun. And the [Shift list](/pages/email-list/) is always open for bikey discussion. So even as we ride our own paths these days, stay in touch with your fellow bike funnists and keep the conversation going 'til we meet again. 

As conditions change and guidelines are updated, we'll be working to figure out additional ways for the calendar to facilitate new approaches to inclusive bike fun. Stay tuned! 

Stay safe, stay healthy!
