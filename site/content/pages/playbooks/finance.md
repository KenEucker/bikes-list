## How to spend money

1. Every expense shall be pre-approved by finance committee.  This should include a ballpark of $ requested even if the final bill is not ready yet.
2. If approved by finance committee, large expenses over $100 shall be further pre-cleared at a board meeting by a majority vote, or if a meeting cannot happen before the expense will be incurred, an email [to the entire board of directors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shift-bod) from the finance lead should happen 1 week in advance and assuming there are no complaints and at least 3 votes from OUTSIDE of the finance committee to approve the expense, this expense will be considered approved.
3. all expenses going forward will be submitted by email and the [shift-bod-finance](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shift-bod-finance) shall be cc:ed to see where the money is going.
4. we will ask umbrella for a before-and-after balance with every request so we can be certain that there is no "unauthorized" money being withdrawn.

## What we can spend money on

Umbrella understands that the Project expects to encounter the following type of expenses:

- expenses related to events described in the scope document above
- operating and developing the SHIFT website
- creating promotional materials for SHIFT and Pedalpalooza, and
- SHIFT event sponsorships and grant program.

And your finance board suggests that these are the "normal" things we spend money on:

- Paying the artist for Artwork, for pedalpalooza (annual, historically $400)
- Merch for pedalpalooza (annual)
- Meet and Greet, or hackathon, snacks (as needed)
- Website expenses  (annual, historically $100-$250)
