## Firstâ€¦

**Please read our [Public health](/pages/public-health/) page** for info on riding safely during this public health crisis. 

## Biking for justice

Even under the current health conditions we recognize that folks are gathering to demand justice. We believe that [bikes are a tool for social change](/pages/mission_statement/) and can liberate and support our communities. 

The [Shift calendar](/pages/calendar/) is one way for the community to organize and publicize bike support in the demand for justice. Bikes can help fill a critical role in supporting events, from delivering supplies to leading groups to boosting morale! If you have a way that bikes can help, [post an event](/addevent/) and get the word out. The [Shift email list](/pages/email-list/) is also another resource to connect with bike-y folks and share info.

## Take a moment

Look at what privileges you have, and consider how to use them to better the community. Offer your time, money, or resources where you can. We all come from a different place and have something to bring. 

Follow the lead of the communities you want to support. To support Black Lives Matter, listen to, believe, and amplify Black voices! 

## Staying safe

Follow [public health](/pages/public-health/) recommendations. We strongly encourage everyone to wear masks, maintain physical distancing, and sanitize frequently. Your community needs you to stay safe and stay healthy!
