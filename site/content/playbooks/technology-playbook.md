This document is out of date as of March 2019.  Check out [more current information in the README on Github](https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs#overview).  Some of this is still useful.

Shift uses [Amazon's AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host our website.  Chris/fool is currently paying for AWS but will submit expenses to Shift for payment.

Shift's Domains are registered through [Dotster](https://www.dotster.com) and are hooked to fool's credit card:

- shift2bikes.org
- shift2bikes.com
- shifttobikes.org
- shifttobikes.com

pedalpalooza.org needs to be transferred from its current registrar soon;  brian scrivner still controls that.

Several people can login, including chris (@fool), Vincent (@sdobz), and Josh (@carrythebanner)

The calendar is written in php, talks to a mysql database that is backed up semi-regularly.

Some of the old website/calendar codebase is in github here: https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shiftcal/tree/Legacy

the [website](https://www.shift2bikes.org) and [calendar](https://shift2bikes.org/calendar/) are their own codebase in github:

https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs

...and has an online bit about contributing too:  https://www.shift2bikes.org/pages/playbooks/website-development/

These are both "in progress".  We generally meet once a week to work on the website/calendar.  Ping the [website crew](mailto:bikecal@shift2bikes.org) to get details about our next meetup.  All are welcome;  coders, testers, content editors, visionaries, etc.
