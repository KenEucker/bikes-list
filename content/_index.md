## Shift brings people in the Portland metro area together with bike fun

Shift encourages folks to create and participate in bike fun.  While our focus is local to the Portland area, our mission is wider:  fun on bikes changes lives and the world.

Come ride your bike with us! Most rides are non-competitive and free-wheeling, tending toward social speeds and smiles. Once you feel comfortable in the saddle, you are encouraged to lead a ride of your own.

Shift is a framework and an enabler - a place to connect with folks, rather than an event organizer.  Our two most notable features fall in this category:

1. [Our online calendar](https://shift2bikes.org/fun)
2. [Pedalpalooza](/pedalpalooza)

## Participating

Shift is entirely volunteer-run, and participant funded.  

If you want to participate, there are a lot of options, all valuable!

First and best is to [come on a bike ride](https://shift2bikes.org/fun).  That's almost always free and you're welcome on any ride listed on the calendar.

If you want to volunteer, great!  Lots of things you could do to help:

1. lead a ride!
2. help facilitate events like pedalpalooza
3. help out with website development - we need authors who can be non-technical, folks to help develop the calendar and designers to help style the website.

If you'd like to donate, that's great too! We don't spend or gather a lot of money, but it does cost money to host our website and to pay the artists who create art for us (particularly pedalpalooza - check out the [gallery of past posters](/gallery)!)


We're updating the content and creating a new website to share the content from http://shift2bikes.org

This repository has a hugo site to help navigate this content, but all content is stored as markdown and should be usable with minimal modifications in another modern site framework.

### Existing content scraped with minimal editing

You can find the existing ported content in [the "Existing" category](/existing)

We're looking to edit this before going live with it.

### TODO

#### Need to port from existing website still

* history (biz meeting notes, images, ride reports, etc)
* xmas carols + stickers + logos
* ride leadership primer + cartoon

#### Needs review

* rest of the "stuff" on the shift website
* wnbr stuff?
* safety?
* visitor info?
* education page?
* get lit (probably ok to go away)

#### Need to create content

What else is missing?

Linked docs are all placeholders in [the "To Create" category](/to-create)

* [what is pedalpalooza and how to pedalpalooze](/pedalpalooza.md)
* [our posse](/posse.md) - associated organizations and groups
