## We're updating the content and creating a new website to share the content from [http://shift2bikes.org](http://shift2bikes.org).


[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shift-docs) contains the existing content and a [hugo](https://gohugo.io)-based website to help navigate the content.  However, all content is stored as [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and should be usable with minimal modifications in any other modern site framework, should someone with more energy and a strong opinion about the architecture for the website come along who is interested in creating something fancier.

Instructions for contribution and modification are in the [README for the GitHub Repository storing the content for this site](https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shift-docs#overview)

All content on the site could use some editing, so if you see something that could be improved, just do it!

## Content to create and enhance

At a high level we have 3 major tasks remaining:

### Existing content scraped with minimal editing
You can find the existing ported content in [the "Existing" category](/existing). 
**We're looking to get input from editors on all of it!**

### Missing things that we should have for launch

Linked docs are all placeholders in [the "To Create" category](/to-create)
* [what is pedalpalooza and how to pedalpalooze](/pedalpalooza.md)
* [our posse](/posse.md) - associated organizations and groups
* [how to participate](/participation.md)
* [Contacting us](/contact.md)

What else is missing?

### Things we need to port from old website still
* history (biz meeting notes, images, ride reports, etc)
* xmas carols + stickers + logos
* ride leadership primer + cartoon

   #### This stuff may or may not get ported from the old site

   * rest of the "stuff" on the shift website
   * wnbr stuff?
   * safety?
   * visitor info?
   * education page?
   * get lit (probably ok to go away)
